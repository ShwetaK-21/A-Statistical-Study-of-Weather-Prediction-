# Weather-Prediction-

## Introduction :
  This project revolves around the prediction of weather conditions specifically for the city of Delhi, India, using a dataset sourced from data.world. While the dataset originally comprises weather data from various locations worldwide, our analysis focuses exclusively on data related to Delhi.
  The dataset includes a plethora of weather parameters essential for weather forecasting, such as temperature (in Celsius), wind speed (in kilometers per hour), wind direction, atmospheric pressure (in inches), precipitation (in inches), humidity, cloud cover, feels-like temperature (in Celsius), and visibility (in kilometers). Additionally, it provides textual descriptions of weather conditions, enabling a comprehensive understanding of the prevailing meteorological phenomena.
  Our primary objective is to leverage advanced data analytics techniques, including machine learning algorithms and statistical modeling, to develop accurate predictive models tailored to the unique climatic characteristics of Delhi. By analyzing historical weather data, we aim to uncover patterns and trends that can help predict future weather conditions with high precision and reliability.
  The insights generated from this project have the potential to benefit a wide range of stakeholders, including government agencies, meteorological departments, transportation authorities, agriculture sectors, and the general public. Accurate weather forecasts can aid in decision-making processes, optimize resource allocation, and enhance preparedness for weather-related events.
  Through this project, we aim to contribute to the advancement of weather prediction capabilities for Delhi, providing stakeholders with reliable and actionable weather forecasts that can support various applications and improve overall resilience to weather-related challenges.

## Problem Statement :
  1. Correlation Analysis : Explore relationship between different weather parameters to understand how they influence each other.
  2. Predicting Weather Conditions: The primary objective is to utilize ordinal logistic regression to predict categorical weather conditions (e.g.,Clear, Fog, Mist, etc,) based on relevant predictor variables such as visibility_km, pressure_in, wind_kph etc.
  3. To develop a model, that will provide future weather prediction.

## Summary :
  This project aims to predict weather conditions using a dataset containing various parameters such as temperature, wind speed, humidity, and atmospheric pressure. The dataset includes information about the country, location name, timezone, last updated time, and weather conditions in text format. The project involves preprocessing the data, exploring feature engineering techniques, and utilizing both time series analysis methods like ARIMA modeling and machine learning approaches like ordinal logistic regression. The goal is to provide accurate and reliable weather forecasts that can be used for decision-making purposes in various industries and applications.
